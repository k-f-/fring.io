Weekends are for getting outside or working on my 110-year-old house.\n\nOutside the day job, I enjoy running, swimming, and climbing. I run a homelab and an orchestrated AI agent workflow for personal projects \u2014 agents delegating across sub-agents, wired through terminal-first tooling.\n\nI'm also studying vehicle dynamics, dialing in suspension, and working toward my first HPDE season.",
