# What I'm Doing Now

**Location:** 📍 Chattanooga, TN, USA  
**Last Updated:** November 2025

## Life

Most mornings I sweat at Crux, an incredible gym with a great community. Progress there has been a massive solace through the second half of Covid-19's 2020. I'm able to get outdoors on the weekends and go hard.

I've made several good friends since moving here and that's ultra rewarding. Content. Life is good.

## Work

**Current Role:** Program Director  
**Company:** Fortune 500 managed care provider

I lead cross-functional initiatives bridging data engineering, analytics, and business strategy. It's rewarding work that impacts tens of thousands of co-workers and many millions of members.

**Previous Role:** Senior Data Analyst/Engineer  
I designed data pipelines, built value-based contracting datasets, and led pharmacy data lake migrations. The deep dive into healthcare data-sets—becoming responsible for the single source of truth—was both challenging and engaging.

## Future

What I'd like in my next role or phase:

- I'd like to use different tools. Microsoft is fine, Teams & PowerBI are very good, but in my heart I'm a FOSS guy: Terminals, Python, R, etc. are more interesting to me.
- I do appreciate the modern need for specialization. However, I'd like to flex a life-time of wearing many hats.
- A good deal more flexibility with working hours. I always deliver. Don't make me sit at a desk just because I need to not be afk. Life is way too short.
