# What I'm Doing Now

**Location:** 📍 Chattanooga, TN / Fayetteville, WV, USA
**Last Updated:** February 2026

## Life

I split my time between Chattanooga, TN and Fayetteville, WV — two towns with world-class outdoor access and tight-knit communities. Weekends are for getting outside or working on my 110-year-old house.

Outside the day job, I enjoy running, swimming, and climbing. I run a homelab and an orchestrated AI agent workflow for personal projects — agents delegating across sub-agents, wired through terminal-first tooling.

I'm also studying vehicle dynamics, dialing in suspension, and working toward my first HPDE season.

## Work

**Current Role:** Program Director
**Company:** Fortune 500 managed care provider

I lead cross-functional teams bridging data engineering, analytics, and business strategy. It's rewarding work that impacts tens of thousands of co-workers and many millions of customers.

## Future

What I'd like in my next role or phase:

- AI leadership. I've spent 25 years teaching myself new domains — networking, systems, devops, data engineering, software. AI is the current one. I'm building orchestrated agent workflows at home and I want to do it professionally.
- A culture that respects focused work over seat time.
- A place where the energy I bring to homelab projects is the norm. I've been a self-taught nerd my entire life and I'm not going to stop.
